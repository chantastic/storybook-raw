```

- add `./storybook/main.js`
  - works! âœ…
  - get loading screen because there are no stories and no configuration to load them

### Add first story

- add `stories` property to `main.js` export, including paths
  - as soon as we provide a path, we go from a loading state to seeing the error that components couldn't be loaded
  - `"../stories/my-first-story.stories.md"`
- i can't seem to get a single .mdx story to load. trying CSF to see if that works.
  - upon further inspection, looks like mdx functionality might be provided by [Docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/introduction), in essentials
